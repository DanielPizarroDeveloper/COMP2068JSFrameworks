                <h3>Entry of contracts to the labor office.</h3>
                <p>
                    This automation project aims to optimize the registration of employment contracts on the Chilean Labor Department's platform. Using UiPath as an RPA tool, C# as the programming language, and SQL Server as the database, the solution enables the automatic and unattended processing and submission of contract information.
                    The system extracts data from the SQL Server database, validates the information, and submits it to the official web platform, eliminating the need for manual intervention. As a result, operational efficiency is improved, errors are minimized, and compliance with labor regulations is expedited.
                    Additionally, the system generates detailed reports of all transactions, providing visibility and traceability throughout the process. This solution not only optimizes time and resources but also ensures greater accuracy and regulatory compliance in contract management.
